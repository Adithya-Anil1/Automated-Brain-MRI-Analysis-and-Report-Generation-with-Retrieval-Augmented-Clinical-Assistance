# Midline Shift

Midline shift refers to the displacement of brain structures from their normal central position to one side of the cranial cavity. It is measured in millimeters on axial MRI or CT images by assessing the deviation of the septum pellucidum, third ventricle, or pineal gland from the anatomical midline.

## Clinical Significance

Midline shift is a critical radiological finding that indicates asymmetric mass effect within the cranial cavity. Common causes include:

- **Space-occupying lesions**: Tumors, abscesses, or hematomas pushing brain tissue to the contralateral side.
- **Cerebral edema**: Unilateral swelling of brain tissue due to ischemic stroke or traumatic injury.
- **Subdural or epidural hematomas**: Fluid collections that compress the underlying brain.

## Measurement

- **Mild shift**: Less than 5 mm — often monitored conservatively.
- **Moderate shift**: 5–10 mm — may indicate significant mass effect requiring intervention.
- **Severe shift**: Greater than 10 mm — associated with increased risk of brain herniation.

## MRI Appearance

On axial MRI slices, midline shift is best appreciated on T2-weighted or FLAIR sequences. The falx cerebri, septum pellucidum, and third ventricle serve as midline reference structures. Any lateral deviation of these structures from the midline indicates shift.

## Relationship to Brain Herniation

Significant midline shift can lead to subfalcine herniation, where the cingulate gyrus is displaced under the falx cerebri. This can compress the anterior cerebral artery and lead to secondary ischemic injury.
