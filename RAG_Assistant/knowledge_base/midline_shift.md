Definition:
Midline shift refers to the displacement of brain structures from their normal central position to one side of the cranial cavity. It is measured in millimeters on axial MRI or CT images by assessing the deviation of the septum pellucidum, third ventricle, or pineal gland from the anatomical midline. Midline shift indicates asymmetric mass effect within the cranial cavity and may be caused by space-occupying lesions such as tumors, abscesses, or hematomas, as well as by unilateral cerebral edema or extra-axial fluid collections. On axial MRI slices, the shift is best appreciated on T2-weighted or FLAIR sequences, where the falx cerebri, septum pellucidum, and third ventricle serve as midline reference structures. Significant midline shift can lead to subfalcine herniation, where the cingulate gyrus is displaced under the falx cerebri.

Why It Appears in the Report:
Midline shift is a quantitative measurement included in MRI reports to describe the degree of lateral displacement of central brain structures caused by the mass effect of a lesion and surrounding edema.

Typical Reporting Units:
Millimeters (mm), measured as the lateral deviation of midline reference structures from the anatomical midline on axial images.

What This Does NOT Mean:
This finding alone does not determine tumor type, grade, prognosis, or required treatment.
