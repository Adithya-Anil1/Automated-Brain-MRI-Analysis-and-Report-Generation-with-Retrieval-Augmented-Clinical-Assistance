Definition:
The non-enhancing tumor core (NCET) refers to the portion of a brain tumor that does not show contrast enhancement on post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images. This region represents tumor tissue where the blood-brain barrier remains relatively intact, or areas of necrosis, cystic change, or hemorrhage within the tumor. It may contain viable infiltrative tumor cells that have not yet disrupted the blood-brain barrier sufficiently to cause enhancement, necrotic (dead) tissue, fluid-filled cystic cavities, or hemorrhagic regions with variable signal characteristics. On T1-weighted pre-contrast images, the non-enhancing core typically appears hypointense relative to normal gray matter and remains non-enhancing after gadolinium administration. On T2-weighted and FLAIR images, it generally appears hyperintense, helping distinguish it from surrounding normal tissue and CSF.

Why It Appears in the Report:
In the BraTS segmentation framework, the non-enhancing tumor core is segmented as a distinct sub-region alongside enhancing tumor and peritumoral edema. Its volume helps quantify the full extent of the tumor beyond the enhancing rim.

Typical Reporting Units:
Cubic centimeters (cm³), derived from voxel-level segmentation.

What This Does NOT Mean:
This finding alone does not determine tumor type, grade, prognosis, or required treatment.
