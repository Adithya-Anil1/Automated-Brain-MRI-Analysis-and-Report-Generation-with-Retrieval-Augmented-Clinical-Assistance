# Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NCET)

The non-enhancing tumor core refers to the portion of a brain tumor that does not show contrast enhancement on post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images. This region represents tumor tissue where the blood-brain barrier remains relatively intact, or areas of necrosis, cystic change, or hemorrhage within the tumor.

## Components

The non-enhancing tumor core can include:

- **Viable non-enhancing tumor cells**: Infiltrative tumor tissue that has not yet disrupted the BBB enough to cause enhancement.
- **Necrosis**: Dead tissue within the tumor center, often seen in high-grade gliomas such as glioblastoma.
- **Cystic components**: Fluid-filled cavities within the tumor.
- **Hemorrhagic regions**: Areas of bleeding that may show variable signal characteristics.

## MRI Appearance

- **T1-weighted (pre-contrast)**: Typically hypointense (dark) relative to normal gray matter.
- **T1-weighted (post-contrast)**: Remains non-enhancing (no signal increase after gadolinium administration).
- **T2-weighted**: Generally hyperintense (bright), though hemorrhagic components may show variable signal.
- **FLAIR**: Hyperintense, helping distinguish it from surrounding normal tissue and CSF.

## Clinical Significance

- The non-enhancing component helps determine the full extent of tumor infiltration beyond the enhancing rim.
- In glioblastoma, the non-enhancing core often contains necrotic tissue, which is a hallmark feature used in diagnosis.
- Monitoring changes in the non-enhancing volume can provide insights into tumor behavior and infiltrative extent.

## BraTS Segmentation

In the BraTS challenge framework, the non-enhancing tumor core (label 1) is segmented as a distinct sub-region alongside enhancing tumor (label 3) and peritumoral edema (label 2). Together, these three components define the whole tumor volume.
