Definition:
Brain tumor MRI protocols typically include four standard sequences, each providing different tissue contrast characteristics. T1-weighted (T1) images provide excellent anatomical detail, with gray matter appearing darker than white matter and CSF appearing hypointense; tumors may appear iso- to hypointense on this sequence. T1-weighted post-contrast (T1CE or T1Gd) images are acquired after intravenous gadolinium administration and are the primary sequence for identifying enhancing tumor tissue, where regions of blood-brain barrier breakdown appear hyperintense. T2-weighted (T2) images are sensitive to water content, with CSF and edema appearing hyperintense, making them effective for detecting fluid-containing lesions. T2-FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) images are similar to T2 but suppress the CSF signal, making peritumoral edema and non-enhancing tumor infiltration more conspicuous, particularly in periventricular regions.

Why It Appears in the Report:
These four sequences are used together by segmentation algorithms such as nnU-Net to distinguish enhancing tumor (T1CE), non-enhancing tumor core (T1 vs T1CE comparison), peritumoral edema (T2/FLAIR), and normal brain tissue.

Typical Reporting Units:
Not applicable. MRI sequences are imaging modalities, not measured quantities.

What This Does NOT Mean:
This finding alone does not determine tumor type, grade, prognosis, or required treatment.
