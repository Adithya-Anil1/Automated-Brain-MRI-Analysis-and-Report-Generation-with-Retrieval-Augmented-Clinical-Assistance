# Glioma Overview

Gliomas are a category of brain tumors that originate from glial cells — the supportive cells of the central nervous system. They are the most common type of primary brain tumor, accounting for approximately 30% of all brain and central nervous system tumors.

## Types of Glial Cells

- **Astrocytes**: Star-shaped cells that support neurons. Tumors arising from astrocytes are called astrocytomas.
- **Oligodendrocytes**: Cells that produce myelin, the insulating sheath around nerve fibers. Tumors from these cells are called oligodendrogliomas.
- **Ependymal cells**: Cells lining the ventricles. Tumors from these cells are called ependymomas.

## WHO Grading System

The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies gliomas by grade based on their microscopic appearance and molecular markers:

- **Grade 1**: Pilocytic astrocytoma — slow-growing, often well-circumscribed.
- **Grade 2**: Diffuse low-grade glioma — infiltrative but slow-growing.
- **Grade 3**: Anaplastic glioma — more aggressive, with increased cellularity and mitotic activity.
- **Grade 4**: Glioblastoma (GBM) — the most aggressive type, characterized by necrosis, microvascular proliferation, and rapid growth.

## MRI Characteristics

On MRI, gliomas present with variable features depending on their grade:

- **Low-grade gliomas**: Often appear as non-enhancing lesions on T1CE, hyperintense on T2/FLAIR, with minimal mass effect and no necrosis.
- **High-grade gliomas**: Typically show contrast enhancement, central necrosis, significant peritumoral edema, and mass effect including potential midline shift.

## Relevance to This Project

This automated brain MRI analysis system is designed to segment and analyze gliomas according to the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) challenge framework. The segmentation model identifies three key sub-regions: enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor core, and peritumoral edema.
