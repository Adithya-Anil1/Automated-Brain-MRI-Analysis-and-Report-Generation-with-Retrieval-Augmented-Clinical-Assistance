Definition:
Gliomas are a category of brain tumors that originate from glial cells, the supportive cells of the central nervous system. They are the most common type of primary brain tumor. The main glial cell types from which gliomas arise include astrocytes (star-shaped cells that support neurons, producing astrocytomas), oligodendrocytes (myelin-producing cells, producing oligodendrogliomas), and ependymal cells (cells lining the ventricles, producing ependymomas). On MRI, gliomas present with variable features: some appear as non-enhancing lesions that are hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR with minimal mass effect, while others show contrast enhancement, central necrosis, significant peritumoral edema, and mass effect including potential midline shift.

Why It Appears in the Report:
This automated brain MRI analysis system segments and analyzes gliomas according to the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) challenge framework. The segmentation model identifies three key sub-regions: enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor core, and peritumoral edema.

Typical Reporting Units:
Not applicable. Glioma is a descriptive category; sub-region volumes are reported individually in cubic centimeters (cm³).

What This Does NOT Mean:
This finding alone does not determine tumor type, grade, prognosis, or required treatment.
