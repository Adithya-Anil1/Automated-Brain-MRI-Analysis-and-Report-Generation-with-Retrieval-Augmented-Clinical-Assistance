Definition:
An enhancing tumor is a region that demonstrates increased signal intensity on post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images following intravenous administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Enhancement occurs because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted in these areas, allowing the contrast agent to leak from blood vessels into the surrounding tissue. The disruption is driven by the formation of abnormal, leaky tumor blood vessels (neoangiogenesis), direct invasion of existing vessel walls, and inflammatory changes in adjacent tissue. On post-contrast T1 images, enhancing regions appear hyperintense and may present as ring-enhancing (bright rim with a dark non-enhancing center), solid or homogeneous, or heterogeneous in pattern.

Why It Appears in the Report:
Enhancing tumor volume is one of the primary sub-region measurements produced by the BraTS segmentation framework. It is reported to quantify the extent of contrast-enhancing tissue identified by the segmentation model.

Typical Reporting Units:
Cubic centimeters (cm³), derived from voxel-level segmentation of post-contrast T1-weighted images.

What This Does NOT Mean:
This finding alone does not determine tumor type, grade, prognosis, or required treatment.
