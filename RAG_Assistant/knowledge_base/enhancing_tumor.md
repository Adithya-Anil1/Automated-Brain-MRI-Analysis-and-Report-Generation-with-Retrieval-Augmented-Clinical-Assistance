# Enhancing Tumor

An enhancing tumor is a region that shows increased signal intensity on post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images after intravenous administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Enhancement indicates areas where the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted, allowing the contrast agent to leak from blood vessels into the surrounding tissue.

## Mechanism of Enhancement

The blood-brain barrier normally prevents large molecules from crossing into brain tissue. In regions of active tumor growth, the BBB is disrupted due to:

- Formation of abnormal, leaky tumor blood vessels (neoangiogenesis)
- Direct invasion and destruction of existing vessel walls
- Inflammatory changes in the surrounding tissue

When gadolinium contrast is injected intravenously, it accumulates in areas where the BBB is compromised, causing those regions to appear bright (hyperintense) on T1-weighted images.

## MRI Appearance

- **Pre-contrast T1**: The tumor may appear isointense or slightly hypointense compared to normal brain.
- **Post-contrast T1**: Enhancing regions appear bright (hyperintense). The pattern of enhancement can be:
  - **Ring-enhancing**: Bright rim with a dark, non-enhancing center (suggesting central necrosis)
  - **Solid/homogeneous**: Uniform enhancement throughout the lesion
  - **Heterogeneous**: Irregular, patchy enhancement

## Clinical Significance

- **Active tumor marker**: Enhancement generally correlates with the most biologically active and aggressive portion of the tumor.
- **Tumor grading**: High-grade gliomas (e.g., glioblastoma) typically show prominent enhancement, while low-grade gliomas may show little or no enhancement.
- **Treatment monitoring**: Changes in enhancing tumor volume over time can indicate response to therapy or disease progression.

## Volume Measurement

In the BraTS segmentation framework, enhancing tumor (ET) is one of the key sub-regions measured. Its volume is reported in cubic centimeters (cm³) and is used alongside non-enhancing tumor and peritumoral edema volumes to characterize the total lesion.
