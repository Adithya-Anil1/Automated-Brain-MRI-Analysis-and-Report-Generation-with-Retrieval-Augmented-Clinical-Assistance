Definition:
Peritumoral edema is the accumulation of excess fluid in the brain tissue surrounding a tumor and is one of the most common findings associated with brain tumors. In the context of brain tumors, it is almost always vasogenic in nature, resulting from disruption of the blood-brain barrier that allows plasma proteins and fluid to leak into the extracellular space of the white matter. On T2-weighted sequences, peritumoral edema appears as a region of high signal intensity surrounding the tumor. On FLAIR sequences, it also appears hyperintense and is particularly conspicuous because the CSF signal is suppressed. On T1-weighted sequences, the edema appears as low signal intensity relative to normal brain parenchyma, and on post-contrast T1, the edema itself does not enhance, helping distinguish it from the enhancing tumor core.

Why It Appears in the Report:
In the BraTS segmentation framework, peritumoral edema is labeled and measured as a distinct sub-region separate from enhancing and non-enhancing tumor components. Its volume contributes to the overall assessment of lesion extent and mass effect.

Typical Reporting Units:
Cubic centimeters (cm³), derived from voxel-level segmentation.

What This Does NOT Mean:
This finding alone does not determine tumor type, grade, prognosis, or required treatment.
